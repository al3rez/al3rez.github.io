I block my time to get more done. It works. Each task gets its own time slot in my day.

## My Simple System

I use a text file for my daily plan. A small program moves these times to my calendar. Here's how it looks:

```
2024-12-11
09:00-10:30 - Write code
10:30-11:00 - Take a walk
11:00-12:00 - Team chat
```

The program does three things:

1. Reads my plan
2. Puts it in my calendar
3. Marks done tasks with a checkmark (âœ“)

## Quick Entry with Cursor Tab

Cursor Tab helps me type faster. It knows what I want to write:

- I type "09" + tab = "09:00-"
- One more tab = common end times
- It learns my usual tasks

No more typing the same things over and over.

## Why It Works

1. **Fast Changes**: I just edit a text file
2. **Works on All Devices**: Phone, computer, tablet
3. **Shows Progress**: Checkmarks tell me what's done
4. **Always Fresh**: Calendar updates right away

## How to Start

You can try this today:

1. Pick 2-3 hours
2. Write down your plan
3. Add space between tasks
4. Look at your plan each night

## What I've Gained

This system has helped me:

- Do more work
- Feel calmer
- See where my time goes
- Remember tasks
- Take real breaks

## Making It Last

Keep it simple:

- Start with big tasks
- Add breaks
- Leave free time
- Change plans when needed

## Next Steps

Start with paper and pen. That's all you need. Later, you can try apps or my auto-sync system. Find what fits you.

The goal isn't a perfect plan. The goal is to know what to do next.
